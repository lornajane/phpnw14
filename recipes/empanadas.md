Empanadas are pastry shell turnovers made by folding dough over a filling, sealing it, and cooking it, either by baking or frying. Just about every Caribbean island has a recipe for sweet or savory fillings.

Every tasty empanada starts with the dough. In Latin Caribbean cooking you'll come across two types of dough. One is simple flour dough much like a pie crust and the other is reddish yellow dough made with yucca. You can use either dough interchangeably, but for beginners, try the simple flour dough first.

Ingredients

3 cups flour (plus a little more for kneading)
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup cold water
1 egg
1 egg white
1 teaspoon vinegar
3 tablespoons shortening
Directions
In a bowl, beat the water, egg, egg white and vinegar together. Set aside.

In a separate bowl, mix together the 3 cups of flour and salt.

Cut the shortening into the flour mix with a pastry blender or two butter knives. Make a well in the center of the flour mix and pour the liquid ingredients from the first bowl into the center.

Mix the wet and dry ingredients with a fork until it becomes stiff.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead it just until all the flour is incorporated and the dough is smooth.

Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, but never more than 24 hours.

Prepare the work surface by lightly flouring the area where you plan to roll out the dough.
