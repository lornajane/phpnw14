2. Tip he flour into a bowl and stir in the ground almonds. Rub in the butter until the mixture is crumbly. Stir in the sugar, then add the eggs, milk, and cherries. Mix until combined, but don't over mix (it will mush the cherries).
3. Spoon into the prepared tin and smooth the top. Then sprinkle the flaked almonds on top. Decorate with any spare cherries. Bake for 1 hour 10 minutes until the cake is golden on top and firm to touch. As with most cakes drive a knife into the cake and check it is clean will removed.

I'm not sure, but olive oil may work as a substitute for the butter
