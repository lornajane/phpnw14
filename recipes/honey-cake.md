# Honey cake
------
## Ingredients:
225g unsalted butter
250g clear honey, plus about 2 extra tablespoon to glaze (or just use almost an entire 340g jar of honey)
100g dark muscovado sugar
3 large eggs, beaten
300g self-raising flour

------
## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 160 degree Celsius / gas mark 3 / fan oven 140 degree Celsius. Butter and line a 20cm / 8 inch round cake tin (ideally use a loose bottomed one).
2. Cut the butter into pieces and add to a medium pan with the honey and sugar. Melt the butter slowly over a low heat. 
3. When it is all turned into a liquid, increase the heat. Boil the liquid for about 1 minute, stirring continuously. 
4. Leave the mixture to cool (I normally leave it for 30 minutes to 1 hour).
5. Once the mixture is cooled, beat the eggs into the mixture using a wooden spoon or similar. 
6. Sift the flour into a large bowl and pour in the egg and honey mixture, beat it until you have a smooth batter.
7. Pour the mixture into the pre-prepared cake tin and bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour, or until the cake is well-risen, golden brown and is slightly firm. Use a knife of skewer to check the insides are cooked.
8. Leave to cool for a few minutes, then separate from the cake tin.
9. Warm 2 tablespooons of honey in a small pan, and then brush over the cake to glaze it.
10. Leave to cool.

Enjoy :)
