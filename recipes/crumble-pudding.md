Fruit Crumble
=============

This crunchy topping can be added to any fruit (or combination of fruits) base, then baked.  For extra yum, serve with custard or vanilla ice cream.

8oz (150g) plain flour
4oz (75g) caster sugar
4oz (75g) butter (margarine is fine)

Put everything in a bowl, and rub it between your fingers until it forms an even, crumbly consistency.

Prepare the fruit and layer in the bottom of an ovenproof dish, cover completely with the topping.  Bake for 20-30 minutes, until fruit is bubbling and crumble is golden on top.
