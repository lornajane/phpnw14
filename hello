Karelian Stew

300 g Beef chuck
300 g pork shoulder
300 g stewing lamb or mutton
2-3 onions
1 1/2 tsp salt
8 whole grains of allspice
Water
Cut the meat into cubes (4x4 cm). There is no need to remove small bones. Set the meat and coarsely chopped onions in layers in a casserole or a cooking pot, seasoning each layer with salt and allspice. Add enough water to almost cover the meat. 

Cook without a cover at a moderate temperature, 175 °C, for 2.5 -3 hours. Cover the pot towards the end of the cooking time. 

Serve with mashed potato, boiled swedes (rutabagas) and lingonberry purée.
